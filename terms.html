  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 29, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Aurasphere. These Terms explain how you can use our CRM Dashboard and AuraPost tools. By using our services, you're agreeing to these terms—so please take a moment to read them.</p>

  <p><strong>Who we are</strong>: Aurasphere is developed and operated by <strong>Black Diamond LTD</strong>, a registered company in Sofia, Bulgaria (Unified Identification Code: UIC 207807571).</p>

  <p>We offer simple, privacy-respecting tools for freelancers and small teams. Our software is designed to give you full control—without hidden tracking or unnecessary complexity.</p>

  <p><strong>Subscriptions & Payment</strong>: All plans are managed through Paddle, our trusted payment partner. You'll receive a receipt for every transaction, and you can manage or cancel your subscription anytime.</p>

  <p><strong>Refund Policy</strong>: 14-day refund period for all plans — no questions asked. Request a refund anytime within 14 days of payment. Contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@aura-sphere.app">hello@aura-sphere.app</a> with your request, and we'll process your refund promptly.</p>

  <p><strong>What we provide</strong>: We do our best to keep the services reliable and secure. However, our tools are provided "as is," and we can't guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>

  <p>We may update these Terms occasionally. If we make significant changes, we'll let you know—but your continued use means you accept the updated version.</p>

  <p>If anything here is unclear, feel free to reach out: <a href="mailto:hello@aura-sphere.app">hello@aura-sphere.app</a>.</p>
